## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
-   **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   SASS
-   [GASP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - JS Animation Library

### What I learned

### Continued development

Try doing the animation without using the GASP library. Conveting the project to Svelte.

### Useful resources

-   [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the GreenSock Animation Platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-the-greensock-animation-platform-7dc9fd9eb826/) - This helped me for understand the types of animation avalable. I learned the basics of timeline animation and how to use it.

-   [GSAP Animation Tutorial | Create Awesome Animations With Javascript by Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyrIPCs47A) - This tutorial taught me how to use the library and integrate it into the workflow. Also I made smaller animation shown in the tutorial to prepare me to complete this flip clock challenge.
